      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">Dear future you,</p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        Are YOU ready to approach women naturally as a part of who you are, have more choice in who
        you sleep with and date, and get a high-quality girlfriend or multiple fuckbuddies?
      </p>

      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        I've been exactly where you are: ready to experience a great dating life, but being confused
        by the conflicting information out there, lacking accountability, and feeling like it wasn’t
        “for me.”
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        I've learned from years of real world experience that I could have accomplished my goals
        many years earlier (avoided mistakes, saved money, and been further ahead) by trusting the
        right mentor to help me...

        <b>
          <i>
            Here's the cold hard truth: every day you DON'T make progress in your dating life,
            you're losing out and pushing it further away from your reality. 93% of the people I
            help accomplish their top dating goal within 6 months of the day they started working
            with me. (And many within 1 month)
          </i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        Most people are stuck watching YouTube videos, reading outdated books like “The Game,”
        getting conflicting information, experiencing blind-leading-the-blind on facebook groups,
        and wasting time not making the progress they truly deserve.
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        That's why more than 2,000 people have applied to work with me.
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        People often message me "Austen, I am different. I am an action taker"... and then proceed
        to waste more time, make more excuses, and ask more of the wrong questions months and even
        years later! I know this because I used to make all the same excuses, and I want to help you
        win.
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        <b>
          <i>
            I've set aside some time to speak to a small number of true action takers. If you're
            ready to skip the nonsense and get right to creating a "Dating Strategy,” then I'm here
            to help.
          </i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        Unlike most others, I spend most of life actually doing this stuff - meeting girls as a part
        of my life; hosting events like parties, photoshoots, group dates; and having threesomes and
        foursomes with my girlfriend.
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        If you'd like to be personally mentored by me, I have an application process with some
        important questions to find out if you are the right type of person for this program.

        ARE YOU A GOOD FIT?
      </h2>
      <hr class="gold-hr animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1" />
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        My team rejects far more people than we accept, precisely because most people are NOT a good
        fit. For me, it's not about who has the most money or who says they want it the most; it’s
        about working with people who are truly dedicated to get results, teachable to follow the
        instructions, enjoyable to work with, and use the techniques and strategies ethically for
        good not for evil.
      </p>
      <p class="animated animatedFadeInUp fadeInUp delay-1">
        With that said, you're likely a good fit if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>
            <em>You're Dedicated.</em>
          </b>
          Working with me isn't free or cheap, but it's way cheaper than doing it on your own. I
          work exclusively with people who will do whatever it takes to accomplish their goals. I'm
          100% dedicated to your success, so if you’re an excuse maker, this program is not for you.
          Because you also need to be 100% dedicated to doing what it takes to succeed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            <em>You're Coachable.</em>
          </b>
          I've honed my diagnostic process after working with hundreds of people like you. My job is
          to consider all of your needs, goals, and wants. That said, there are times I will tell
          you "You need to do THIS,” and you need to be ready to listen if you want to succeed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            <em>You're Ethical.</em>
          </b>
          My techniques of game and persuasion are potently effective, so I need to be sure
          everything you do with it is 100% moral and legal. Also, I keep my promises and I expect
          you to keep your promises. If you don't believe in keeping your word or meeting women from
          a healthy place, I won't help you. Period.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>
            <em>You Trust Me.</em>
          </b>
          No matter how many times I'm interviewed by outlets like Vice or The Star, or how many
          how-to videos I produce, some people will never be willing to work with me. If you think
          that you know more than every expert out there or have a narcissistic, self-sufficiency
          trait, then do not apply. If you trust me to lead you by the hand to your goals, then
          apply.
