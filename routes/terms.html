        I do not and will not own, operate or work for a company or internet website that teaches
        men how to be successful with women and dating for 4 years after attending the program, in
        any city. I will forfeit to Austen Summers any revenue earned from operating or working for
        a company or internet website that teaches men how to be successful with women and dating
        during the 4 year period, and I am still obligated to keep all trade secrets confidential.

        learn at this training and other third-party providers used, or any other product or service
        you are exposed to as a result of my relationship with Austen Summers. I agree to forgo
        litigation and settle the matter using Binding Arbitration if a conflict should arise
        between Austen Summers (including its staff and Principal) and I. Austen Summers retains the

          5. Cancellation, Refund, and Transfer Policy for Immersion Programs and Bootcamp Programs
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For all programs worldwide, the cancellation, refund, and transfer policy is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the level of commitment necessary to reach your goals, there are no refunds
        whatsoever. This also helps you “burn the boats,” so you’re completely invested in the
        program, do the assignments, and accelerate your personal growth and results. However, you
        can transfer your Immersion or Bootcamp program to another date. For Immersion or Bootcamp
        programs worldwide, the transfer policy is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you transfer 30 days or more prior to the first day of your Immersion or Bootcamp
          program: $50 transfer fee
        </li>
        <li>
          If you transfer within 30 days of the first day of your Immersion or Bootcamp program:
          $500 transfer fee
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 6. Cancellation and Refund Policy + Transfer Policy for Mentorship Programs </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For all programs worldwide there are no refunds after deposit transaction, as you
        immediately gain access to the online course. This also helps you “burn the boats,” so
        you’re completely invested in the program, do the assignments, and accelerate your personal
        growth and results.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no “credit” system in place for taking back payments for the time and service you
        do not use. You may pause your involvement in the program, but you may not pause payments.
        <i>
          (E.g. Taking the program in January, pausing in February due to traveling with a girl,
          then continuing the program in March and April. Payments would be due and end in February,
          but program access would end in April).
        </i>
      </p>

      <p class="mt-5">
        <b> 7. Client Standards </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        The client (buyer) must comply to the standards of the program outlined to him by his coach
        (the seller) which may include:
      </p>
      <ul>

          Having basic daily habits such as meditation, eating healthy, exercising, and personal
          hygiene during the entire duration of the program
        </li>

        <li>Any mission or task that is given to the client (buyer) by the coach (seller)</li>
